Powuh Gred
===========

Yes, this is remake of the board game Power Grid. Written in NodeJS for the pure
benefit of making us better game developers and working together to produce a
viable playable game. A boardgame was chosen for its simplicity of design and
implementation.

Power Grid is a game of market superiority. Your goal is to power more cities
than your opponents. Power plants are brough to auction for all players to bid
on, powered by coal, oil, garbage or uranium or wind, they are the workhorses of
your utility.  Resources are purchased in a market where prices are dominated by
supply and demand.  Players build out their connections to more cities in a
network like fashion and earn money for the number of cities powered.
